# APOD Gallery

A Flutter application that implements NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day API.
This apllication is part of my journey into Flutter development, so it shouldn't be taken as a fully, well terminated app, and more like a work in progress.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

This project uses Flutter version 2.8.1 and can be managed using [Flutter Version Manager (fvm)](https://fvm.app/).

It also requires an API Key to access NASA APIs and can be obtained for free in the [NASA APIs website](https://api.nasa.gov/)
